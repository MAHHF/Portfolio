        <p>Welcome, however you found your way here!
This isn’t your typical portfolio. It’s a space that breaks free from rules – a place where my creativity can breathe. Here, ideas, experiments, and moments come alive and find a home.
Many of the things you’ll find here have a documentary quality to them. They reflect life as I see and experience it – in the light of day, but especially at night, when the world takes on a different shape.
Sometimes, I go through creative phases where I simply create without a plan, driven by the urge to explore. What emerges is a mix of inspiration, chaos, and expression, all of which find their place here.
For me, this space is like a diary. For you? Maybe an invitation to discover. However you ended up here, feel free to watch, feel, or simply think along.</p>
